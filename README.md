Circuit Breaker pattern implemented using Netflixâ€™s Hystrix library 
(See more at: https://spring.io/guides/gs/circuit-breaker/)

## Assumptions

- There is no need to support HTML email body types
    - (inferred) There is no need to support attachments
- An email can be sent with no body
- There is no need to support multiple "Personalizations" to specify different handling instructions for
 different recipients(See more at: https://sendgrid.com/docs/Classroom/Send/v3_Mail_Send/personalizations.html)

## Install and setup

## Concerns

- Creation of SendGridRequestBody object seems expensive and long. *TODO*: Research for better implementation

## Thoughts

- Using the Circuit Breaker pattern from the Netflix Hystrix library seemed possible as a method of implementing
effective failover, however Fallback functionality seems intended for returning an acceptable response to the user, 
rather than making another service call that could also fail
